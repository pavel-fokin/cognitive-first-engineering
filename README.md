# Cognitive-First Engineering

**Designing systems for finite human cognition in an era of infinite generation.**

Systems fail not because of insufficient execution power, but because they exceed the limits of human understanding.

Cognitive-First Engineering is a discipline for designing software systems, teams, and processes around the **biological constraints of human cognition**.

## The Problem

Modern software engineering is optimized along three primary axes:

- **Hardware** — exponential gains in compute, storage, and bandwidth (Moore’s Law).
- **Tools** — AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling.
- **Organization** — processes, roles, and methodologies for coordinating people.

One axis is missing.

**Human cognition is never explicitly modeled as a limiting resource.**

This creates a growing gap between what systems can produce and what humans can reliably reason about. 

**That gap is where burnout, coordination collapse, and cognitive debt emerge.**

## What Is Cognitive-First Engineering?
Cognitive-First Engineering is a set of **principles, models and practices** for building systems under real human cognitive limits.

It applies to:
- team and organizational design,
- software architecture,
- development processes,
- AI-assisted workflows.

The central thought is simple:

> **The primary bottleneck of modern systems is not execution — it is comprehension.**

## The Foundation Principles

These principles describe **invariants**, not best practices.
They are independent of tools, methodologies, or intent.

- Thinking precedes artifacts.
- Human cognition is biologically bounded.
- Attention is serial with switching costs.
- Understanding decays with time unless maintained.
- Coordination cost grows superlinearly with the number of people.

The goal is to keep them minimal and orthogonal.

All other laws, patterns, and practices in this repository are derived from them.
